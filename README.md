## About Foodie-Friend


Foodie friend is an Android app for restaurant fans. Fans that may be trying new restaurants without recommendations or may find themselves eating at the same places every time they go. We are among those fans. Nothing frustrates us more than deciding to forgo a known good restaurant we’ve been to many times and instead venturing out of our norms.


### Interactive Design
Our users will interact with the system when they open the app, and a queue of restaurants is generated based on their personal model. The restaurant that is at the front of the queue is the only restaurant displayed to the user. The user can act on this restaurant by swiping on it, to the left or the right. Swiping to the left indicates the user does not like this restaurant, while swiping right indicates a like. Either way, swiping on the restaurant removes it from the queue, and will update the user’s personal model based on the direction they swiped on. The restaurant that was second in the queue is moved up to the front of the queue, and the user can repeat this cycle as much as they want.
